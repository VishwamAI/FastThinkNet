## Summary of Findings

The research has identified three advanced statistical methods that could potentially enhance the FastThinkNet model: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), Gaussian Processes (GPs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Each method offers unique benefits and challenges:

1. BNNs provide uncertainty estimation and improved robustness, but may increase computational complexity.
2. GPs excel in handling non-linear relationships and limited data scenarios, but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
3. VAEs enhance feature extraction and generative capabilities, but may require careful tuning and increase model complexity.

The implementation of these methods should be considered based on the specific requirements and constraints of the FastThinkNet project, taking into account the trade-offs between performance improvements and computational resources.
