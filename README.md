# FastThinkNet

FastThinkNet is a neural network library designed for the development of fast thinking agents, integrating the power of PyTorch and TensorFlow. It implements concepts from deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play, inspired by the work of Ilya Sutskever.

## Installation

To install FastThinkNet, run the following command:

```bash
pip install FastThinkNet
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use FastThinkNet:

```python
from FastThinkNet.models import AdvancedModel

# Initialize the model
model = AdvancedModel()

# Train the model on your data
model.train(data)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(test_data)
```

To train the model using the neural learning agent:

```bash
python scripts/train_neural_agent.py --use_neural_agent
```

## Features

- Integration of PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Implementation of advanced neural network architectures
- Support for deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play

## Neural Learning Agent Integration

FastThinkNet now incorporates a neural learning agent, enhancing the model's ability to learn and adapt. This integration allows for more sophisticated learning strategies and improved performance across various tasks. To use the neural learning agent, simply add the `--use_neural_agent` argument when running the training script.

## Advanced Statistical Methods

FastThinkNet now includes advanced statistical methods to enhance model performance and capabilities:

- Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN): Improved uncertainty estimation and robustness
- Gaussian Processes (GP): Enhanced prediction and interpolation capabilities
- Variational Autoencoders (VAE): Powerful generative modeling and representation learning

## Project Structure

The project structure has been updated to include:

- `scripts/neural_learning_agent/`: Contains the new `train_neural_agent.py` script for training with the neural learning agent

## Dependencies

In addition to the existing dependencies, FastThinkNet now requires:

- tensorflow
- gym
- numpy
- matplotlib
