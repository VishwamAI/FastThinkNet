# FastThinkNet

FastThinkNet is a neural network library designed for the development of fast thinking agents, integrating the power of PyTorch and TensorFlow. It implements concepts from deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play, inspired by the work of Ilya Sutskever.

## Installation

To install FastThinkNet, run the following command:

```bash
pip install FastThinkNet
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use FastThinkNet:

```python
from FastThinkNet.models import AdvancedModel

# Initialize the model
model = AdvancedModel()

# Train the model on your data
model.train(data)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(test_data)
```

## Features

- Integration of PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Implementation of advanced neural network architectures
- Support for deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play
